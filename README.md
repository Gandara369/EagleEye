# EagleEye: AI-Powered Trading Indicator with Asia Range and Custom Sessions

EagleEye is a custom indicator designed for Forex and cryptocurrency traders, offering clear visualizations of key market sessions such as Asia, London, and New York. The core of this indicator focuses on the Asian session, providing price ranges and deviation levels that help traders identify potential breakout zones and key support/resistance points.

This project is in its **initial phase**, with plans to **integrate artificial intelligence (AI)** to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of session analysis. Currently, the code serves as the **skeleton** of a more advanced tool, and over time, AI will be integrated to detect patterns, enhance alerts, and make predictions based on both historical and real-time data.

## Core Idea

The central concept of **EagleEye** is to use the price range of the Asian session as an initial guide for traders. The belief is that the Asian session can set important levels that influence the openings and closings of subsequent sessions, such as London and New York. With the integration of artificial intelligence, the indicator will learn from past data, optimizing trading decisions through predictive analysis.

Currently, the code includes:
- Calculation of the Asian session range with options to display deviations (breakout levels).
- Graphical representation of the ranges of the London and New York sessions.
- Optional breakout alerts to help traders act at critical moments.

This is just the **beginning**, and **the project will continue to evolve** with the integration of AI and additional features.

## Current Features

1. **Asian Session Range Visualization**:
   - The indicator visually displays the highs and lows of the Asian session (19:00 - 00:00), allowing traders to quickly identify key price zones.
   - Optional deviation lines can be added to detect potential breakout zones.

2. **London and New York Sessions**:
   - In addition to the Asian session, the indicator also visualizes the ranges of the London (02:00 - 06:00) and New York (07:00 - 10:00) sessions, helping traders analyze how price action evolves throughout the day.

3. **Breakout Alerts**:
   - The indicator can trigger custom alerts when the price breaks above or below the Asian session range. These alerts are useful for traders looking for entry or exit points based on price behavior during the Asian session.

4. **Full Customization**:
   - Session times, colors, and deviation lines are fully customizable, allowing traders to tailor the indicator to their specific needs.

## Artificial Intelligence Integration

In future updates, AI will be integrated to:
- **Identify trading patterns** beyond the predefined sessions, using historical data.
- **Predict price movements** based on the behavior of previous session ranges and other technical indicators.
- **Optimize alerts**: AI will adjust alerts based on predictive analysis, issuing alerts at key market moments.

The goal is for the indicator to not only be reactive (displaying already-formed levels), but also **proactive**, using AI to anticipate potential market moves.

## Future Development Plan

This indicator is in its initial version and **will continue to develop** with new features and improvements to make it a more complete and powerful tool. The next development phases will include:

- **Full AI Integration**: AI will be implemented to enhance the precision of real-time predictions and analysis.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: More options will be added to customize range boxes, such as line styles, dynamic colors based on volatility, and adjustable sizes.
- **Incorporation of New Strategies**: The project will expand to include strategies based on breakouts, pullbacks, and other trading patterns that can be identified in global trading sessions.
- **Advanced Alerts**: More advanced alerts based on AI will be introduced to complement the analysis of trading sessions.
